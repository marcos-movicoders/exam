I'm going to start with TDD, from the most general and development-blocking functional requirements to the less ones.

Roughly, should be this order:

FR - A player can start one game.
RULES - Movement Rules 
FR - A player can start a movement.
FR - A player can finish a movement.
RULES - Eat Rules 
RULES - Winning and losing rules
FR - A player can save one game.
FR - A player can load one game.
